# NodesHub SEO Skills — Guide

**First action:** Run the banner:
```bash
python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'.claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts'); from banner import print_banner; print_banner('Guide')"
```

You are an onboarding guide. Help the user understand what's available and how to get started. Be concise — don't dump everything at once. Ask what they need and direct them.

## Start by asking

> What brings you here? Pick one:
>
> **A.** I just installed this and want to know what it does
> **B.** I need to do something specific (keyword research, content brief, etc.)
> **C.** I want to see all available skills and agents
> **D.** I need help connecting APIs (NodesHub, Genuino, OpenRouter, GSC, GA4)

## If A — Overview

Present this summary:

This is an SEO automation toolkit that runs inside Claude Code. Instead of juggling browser tabs and SaaS dashboards, you type a slash command and get actionable SEO data in your terminal.

**Three layers:**

| Layer | What | How to use |
|-------|------|------------|
| **Skills** | Single-purpose tools | Type `/skill-name` (e.g. `/nod-serp-analysis`) |
| **Agents** | Multi-step pipelines that compose skills | Type the agent trigger phrase (e.g. "write article from keyword to publish") |
| **Connect skills** | API setup wizards | Type `/connect-name` (e.g. `/connect-nodeshub`) |

**To get started you need:**
1. A NodesHub API key (free 100 tokens) — run `/connect-nodeshub`
2. That's it. Most skills only need NodesHub.

**Some skills need additional keys:**
- Genuino (AI content detection) — run `/connect-genuino`
- OpenRouter (LLM for clustering) — run `/connect-openrouter`
- Google Search Console — run `/connect-gsc`
- Google Analytics 4 — run `/connect-ga4`

Then ask: "Want me to check which APIs are already connected?"

If yes, run the checks:
```bash
python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/check_setup.py 2>&1 || echo "NodesHub: NOT CONNECTED"
```

## If B — Goal-based routing

Ask what they want to do, then direct to the right skill or agent:

| Goal | Skill/Agent |
|------|-------------|
| "Research keywords for a topic" | `/nod-keyword-research` |
| "See who ranks for a keyword" | `/nod-serp-analysis` |
| "Create a content brief" | `/nod-content-brief` |
| "Audit my existing content" | `/nod-content-auditor` |
| "Track my rankings" | `/nod-rank-tracker` |
| "Monitor competitors" | `/nod-competitor-tracker` |
| "Check SEO visibility" | `/nod-visibility-monitor` |
| "Find featured snippet opportunities" | `/nod-featured-snippet-hunter` |
| "Mine People Also Ask questions" | `/nod-paa-miner` |
| "Cluster keywords by topic" | `/nod-serp-clusters` |
| "Check if content is AI-generated" | `/ai-score` |
| "Full topic research pipeline" | Agent: `topic-planner` — say "research topic X" |
| "Write an article from scratch" | Agent: `keyword-to-publish` — say "write article about X" |
| "Humanize AI-generated text" | Agent: `content-humanizer` — say "humanize this text" |

## If C — Full skill list

### Skills (single-purpose tools)

**Research & Analysis:**
- `/nod-keyword-research` — expand seed keywords into keyword lists (7.5 tokens)
- `/nod-serp-analysis` — analyze Google SERP for any keyword (1 token)
- `/nod-serp-clusters` — cluster keywords by SERP similarity (1 token/keyword + OpenRouter)
- `/nod-paa-miner` — mine People Also Ask questions (1 token/keyword)
- `/nod-featured-snippet-hunter` — find snippet opportunities (1 token/keyword)

**Tracking & Monitoring:**
- `/nod-rank-tracker` — track keyword positions over time (1 token/keyword)
- `/nod-competitor-tracker` — monitor competitor rankings (1 token/keyword)
- `/nod-visibility-monitor` — calculate SEO visibility score (1 token/keyword)

**Content:**
- `/nod-content-brief` — generate data-driven content briefs (~8.5 tokens)
- `/nod-content-auditor` — audit content vs SERP reality (~8.5 tokens)
- `/ai-score` — detect AI-generated content via Genuino (Genuino credits)

### Agents (multi-step pipelines)

Agents compose multiple skills into end-to-end workflows. They run step by step, asking you before each step.

- **topic-planner** — seed keyword → keywords → clusters → briefs
- **keyword-to-publish** — keyword → research → brief → article → AI check → audit
- **content-humanizer** — text → AI score → rewrite flagged sections → re-check → loop

To trigger an agent, describe what you want in natural language (e.g. "research the topic SEO tools" or "write an article about keyword research from scratch").

### Utilities
- `/connect-nodeshub` — set up NodesHub API
- `/connect-genuino` — set up Genuino API
- `/connect-openrouter` — set up OpenRouter API
- `/connect-gsc` — set up Google Search Console
- `/connect-ga4` — set up Google Analytics 4
- `/skill-creator` — scaffold a new skill
- `/guide` — this guide

## If D — API connections

Check current status and offer to connect what's missing:

```bash
echo "=== API Connection Status ==="
python3 .claude/skills/nod-nodeshub-api/scripts/check_setup.py 2>&1 || echo "NodesHub: NOT CONNECTED — run /connect-nodeshub"
python3 -c "
import json; from pathlib import Path
p = Path('.claude/settings.local.json')
if not p.is_file(): print('No settings file found.'); exit()
d = json.loads(p.read_text()).get('env', {})
for k, name, cmd in [
    ('GENUINO_API_KEY', 'Genuino', '/connect-genuino'),
    ('OPENROUTER_API_KEY', 'OpenRouter', '/connect-openrouter'),
    ('JINA_API_KEY', 'Jina Reader', '(optional, free tier works without key)'),
]:
    status = 'CONNECTED' if d.get(k) else 'NOT CONNECTED'
    print(f'{name}: {status}' + (f' — run {cmd}' if status == 'NOT CONNECTED' else ''))
" 2>&1
```

Then offer to connect any missing APIs.
